# Create a custom Dataset for images 
 Output as a .CSV file


# How to create a file

- make sure all your images are the same file type (.JPG or .PNG)
- make sure all your images are the same size (You can easily alter the size online if needed)
- rename all your images to the same class name (fa. all the pictures of a duck are called: duck, duck_1, duck_2, etc. and the raccoons are called: raccoon, raccoon_1, etc.)
- merge all the pictures into the content folder (create this folder if its not there)
- configure the script 
- Run the script and enjoy your dataset!

## Configuring the script
- make sure the filetype at line 9 is the type you set your pictures to (either .jpg or .png)
- set the keywords of your classes at line 14
- give your CSV a name at line 56
